## The Problem

Data scientist is one of the best suited professions to thrive this century. It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace.

However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.

And how can you do that?

Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming)

Most online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture

## The Solution

Data science is a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses a wide range of topics.

Understanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out

Mathematics

Statistics

Python

Applying advanced statistical techniques in Python

Data Visualization

Machine Learning

Deep Learning

Each of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you don’t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is.

So, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2022.

We believe this is the first training program that solves the biggest challenge to entering the data science field – having all the necessary resources in one place.

Moreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course teaches you everything you need to know to become a data scientist at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save).

## The Skills

1.  Intro to Data and Data Science

Big data, business intelligence, business analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We know these buzzwords belong to the field of data science but what do they all mean?
Why learn it? As a candidate data scientist, you must understand the ins and outs of each of these areas and recognise the appropriate approach to solving a problem. This ‘Intro to data and data science’ will give you a comprehensive look at all these buzzwords and where they fit in the realm of data science.

2.  Mathematics

Learning the tools is the first step to doing data science. You must first see the big picture to then examine the parts in detail.

We take a detailed look specifically at calculus and linear algebra as they are the subfields data science relies on.
